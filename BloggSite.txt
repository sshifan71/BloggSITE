So we will be making a One SuperUser in the terminal to add
data to the database. This will be a BLOGGING SITE.
So far we have done:
    1. Added an app called Gallery
    2. We are calling each Blogg a 'Product'. In models file
        we have defined a class named Product and specified
        its objects i.e Name,Description,Image etc.
    3. In the models file, we have also added 2 more functions.
        one is to edit the previous entry and the other one is to
        shorten the description to be showable.
    4.
